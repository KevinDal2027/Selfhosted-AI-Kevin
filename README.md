Kevin AI (Self-hosted AI)

This is my self-hosted personal AI assistant that runs locally on my home server.
It’s hosted at ai.kevinqh.com

Tech Stack
- Docker – for containerization
- Node.js – backend logic and API handling
- FastAPI / Python – model communication layer
- Ollama – local model hosting and management

Built this just for fun to experiment with running AI completely on my own hardware, I didn't wanna waste a 2014 ThinkPad laptop lol.
